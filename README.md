# Qwant Instant Answers 4.0.0

The Instant Answers project aims at enhancing **Qwant**'s search engine by providing direct answers to a User's query.
Our main goal is to provide the most relevant answer in the least amount of time to a User's query. A ribbon at the top of the results page displays what we think is the best answer to the query, when available.

**Example**:

Qwant has already developed several Instant Answers modules, and decided to open them to contributions. **Your help is appreciated!**
You can help improve Qwant's Instant Answers through different actions:
* Improving the existing Instant Answers modules
